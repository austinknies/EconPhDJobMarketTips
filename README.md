# EconPhDJobMarketTips
This repository is a place where I am hosting resources from my experience on the Economics Ph.D. job market during the 2023-24 academic year. Please feel welcome to use any of this if it is useful to you!

What's here:
- **Job Market Notes**: a set of notes about navigating the end stage of the PhD and the job market itself from my perspective. I made these as I went to help remember key details of the process, especially the things that surprised me or stuck out to me along the way.

- **Job Market List Template**: a spreadsheet template to stay on top of the posted jobs that have your interest across all of the job posting websites
