# EconPhDJobMarketTips
This repository is a place where I am hosting resources from my experience on the Economics Ph.D. job market during the 2023-24 academic year. Please feel welcome to use any of this if it is useful to you!

What's here:
- [**Job Market Notes**](https://github.com/austinknies/EconPhDJobMarketTips/blob/main/JobMarketNotes_AK.pdf): a set of notes about navigating the end stage of the Ph.D. and the job market itself from my perspective. These notes evolved from just trying to keep track of everything, and so I emphasize what felt especially important or underrated to me.

- [**Job Market List Template**](https://github.com/austinknies/EconPhDJobMarketTips/blob/main/jobmarket_list_AK.xlsx): a spreadsheet template to stay on top of the posted jobs that have your interest across all of the job posting websites.
